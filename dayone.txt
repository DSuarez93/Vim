5 Modes within Vim:

	Press r and a character to replace the character currently under the cursor.

Visual: Press v

	or press a to append to the document, moving the cursor one space after it was in normal mode.
	or press o to open, making a new line and move the cursor to the beginning of the new line.
	or press I to start at the beginning of the line.
	or press O to make a new line above instead of below the cursor.
	or press A to go to the end of the line.

Replace: press R to edit directly overwrite the text instead of appending.
