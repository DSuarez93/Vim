The key to using Vim is muscle memory. Get used to movement and shortcuts.

Modes other than Normal mode will be indicated within here

5 Modes within Vim:
Normal: Press Escape
	use hjkl to move cursor around, all keys are on home row to emphasize typing speed
	Press r and a character to replace the character currently under the cursor.

Visual: Press v
Insert: Press i
	or press a to append to the document, moving the cursor one space after it was in normal mode.
	or press o to open, making a new line and move the cursor to the beginning of the new line.
	or press I to start at the beginning of the line.
	or press O to make a new line above instead of below the cursor.
	or press A to go to the end of the line.

Replace: press R to edit directly overwrite the text instead of appending.

:# : go to line number

	#dd: # lines including cursor and below
	dw: Current word
	d$: To the end of the line
	x: remove current character under cursor

Undo/Redo
	u: undo last command
	Ctrl+r: redo last command

Yanking
	yy: "Yanks" entire line
	p: push, or paste, yanked line
	
gg=g: reformats document to remove hard tabs, make easier to read, depends on vim configuration
